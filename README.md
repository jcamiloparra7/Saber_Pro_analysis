# Saber_Pro_Analysis
Analysis of the factors associated with the results of the Saber Pro tests of Industrial Engineering students at universities in Colombia, using data mining and text mining techniques.

The Colombian State generates a large amount of data daily through his missionary processes, this data must be transformed into useful information that leads to improved government efficiency in practices aimed at the analysis and improvement of public policy design. This article explores the application of the KDD (Knowledge Discovery in Databases) methodology to a database containing the results of the Saber Pro-2019 tests published by the ICFES. Statistical and mathematical analyses were performed on the variables deemed of interest, a classification model was adjusted on the Higher Education Institutions (IES), students were grouped by socioeconomic classification and typological profiles were created for each group. Additionally, the relationship between socioeconomic classification, higher education institution and overall score was studied by means of a decision tree. Finally, a sentiment analysis was performed and word clouds were constructed based on the results of a survey related to the saber Pro tests. It is concluded that the socioeconomic category is a variable with statistical significance on the overall score; however, its influence is trivialized in comparison with the effect that the institution of higher education has over the global score. It is also observed that there is a greater proportion of students with higher socioeconomic categories as the university category increases.

Globally, the development of standardized tests is done in order to quantitatively demonstrate what students have learned and retained in the academic environment, these results are used as a standard to measure the progress of the institution in the development of skills and the generation of knowledge in their students (Wray, 2016), making educational institutions aware of their responsibility regarding the achievement and academic performance of their students (Driscoll, Halcoussis, & Svorny, 2008).
In the middle of the 20th century, given the need to assess the performance of educational institutions in Latin America, a group of professors was asked to prepare multiple choice tests and standardize the results on a curve, but it was in the 1960s that this type of tests began to be used as entrance exams in programs with high demand in higher education such as the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) and the Technological Institute of Monterrey (ITM). 
For its part, in 1968 in Colombia the Colombian Institute for the Promotion of Higher Education (ICFES) was founded, responsible for the development of these tests (Rizo, 2010) with their subsequent application in the evaluation of education in the primary and secondary stages. Finally, by 2000, the exam was extended to professional evaluation with the creation of the ECAES tests and in 2009 all the existing tests were grouped into what is known today as the SABER tests. ("50 years of ICFES," n.d.).
Since the results of these tests allow a measurement of the quality of the programs offered, the Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) make use of the results obtained to attract new students, not to mention that the policies issued by the Ministry of National Education (MEN) are considered according to the performance of the HEIs in the tests (Mart√≠nez Lobo, 2013) is why it is of vital importance for HEIs to know and understand how the results of the SABER PRO exam can be influenced by certain factors, for example, by academic and sociodemographic factors, in order to focus their resources and policies towards the implementation of support programs that allow them to improve their results. 
One of the most effective ways to evaluate which factors have the greatest influence on outcomes is through data analytics, which consist of the application of algorithms for the analysis of medium or large data sets, which seek to extract trends, patterns and relationships between variables that facilitate and optimize decision making (Ed & Goebel, 2013). 
Consequently, this project proposes the application of computational tools of data analytics, in conjunction with statistical methods and text mining to assess the performance of students of the Industrial Engineering program in the SABER PRO tests in order to identify the different variables that affect the performance of their students, and perform an adequate characterization of them and the variables that affect their performance in order to obtain quantitative and qualitative information necessary to facilitate the corresponding entities the development and implementation of educational policies that favor the program and improve the quality of education received by their students.
